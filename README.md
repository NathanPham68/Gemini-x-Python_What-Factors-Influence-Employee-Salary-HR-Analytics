## I. Introduction

This project explores the key factors that impact employee salaries using a structured HR dataset. The dataset contains over 6,700 records with demographic and professional attributes, including Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience and Salary.

Through data cleaning, descriptive statistics and visual analytics, the project aims to uncover insights such as:

* How experience and education influence salary levels

* Gender-based salary disparities

* Salary variations across different job titles and industries

The project leverages Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing and exploratory analysis and Power BI for interactive data visualization and reporting.
